# Lossless (de)compression of arbitrary data

This repository was my submission for an assignment for the "Algorithms and Data Structures 3" course at UGent. We were tasked to implement an encoder/decoder
by modifying the existing Adaptive Huffman algorithm to accept labels larger than 1 byte. A detailed explanation (in Dutch) on how the algorithm
was implemented/modified, along with compression tests on [The Canterbury Corpus](https://corpus.canterbury.ac.nz/), can be found in the `extra` folder.
The original assigment (also in Dutch) is available in the assignment folder. The code can be found in `src`, it should be very readable.
